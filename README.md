# Student Management System with BST

This is a simple C++ program to manage a list of students. It allows you to add, retrieve, update, remove, and display students using a Binary Search Tree (BST).

## Features
1. **Add Student**: Add a student (ID, name, generation).
2. **Retrieve Student**: Retrieve a student by ID (using BST search).
3. **Update Student**: Update a student's details.
4. **Remove Student**: Remove a student by ID.
5. **Display All Students**: Display all students in sorted order (in-order traversal).

## Before Using
Here are the inputs you shouldn't use:
- Anything that is not what is asked (e.g., a letter when a number is asked).
- In the ID section: a number that exceeds 11 digits.

TBD
- Beware, the memory reset each time you lunch the program.
## How to Use
1. Compile the program:
    ```bash
    g++ -o student_manager student_manager.cpp
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./student_manager
    ```
